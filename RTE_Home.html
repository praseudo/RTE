    <p>This is basically used to cut down you reporting time after hunting for bugs in the bug bounty. Most of the hunters spend more their time on writing reports with proper markdowns to make their reports more attractive.
        Because I believe that the more attractive the report is the more bounty you get. </p>

    <p>So here comes the Reporting Template Engine (RTE) which will describes about the bug, mitigation and resources links on how to test and how to fix the issue. All these comes
     with the markdown templates which makes the reports look good. </p>

    <p> Here is the Hackerone Markdown link https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/using-markdown.html </p>

    <p> Am sure this will work for the Hackerone bug bounty platform but don't know these markdowns work on Bugcrowd, Intigriti, Synack, etc. :D </p>


    <p> Note: The content, links that are presented in RTE are gathered from various sources from the internet which are publicly available. </p>
